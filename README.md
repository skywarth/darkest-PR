## Roadmap

- Including voice lines as sound file to comments


## Notes to self

### Smee.io

Smee.io is a free service for relaying local webhooks to internet.

"Receives payloads then sends them to your locally running application."

It has a client (your localhost) library for the target, available in node.js

Probot basically runs this in the background (when you?) start the app in local

- I suppose `WEBHOOK_PROXY_URL` is to be change when you deploy, I mean why would it use Smee if not in local?

### Blunder of imports

Node.js refuses to allow extensionless imports, e.g: `import {QuoteFacade} from "./QuoteFacade";`

Therefor you have to add `.js` extension to each import. Which is looking very dumb to do in typescript

Ridiculous.
